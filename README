to use this code, add the lib directory to your RUBYLIB:

export RUBYLIB=`pwd`/site_lib:$RUBYLIB

To learn more about this face, you can then run:

puppet help dashboard

The ability to set parameters is only supported if
the Face is used programmatically:

  Puppet::Face[:dashboard, :current].create_node(:name => 'name', :parameters => {'param1' => value'})

Requirements
===========

This module requires that puppet cloud provisioner be installed and available
in ruby's loadpath.

Right now, it is coded against commit: c790ed6ae4c7f45a1c2fbc815c9078e3db98174b

I suspect this will wind up being 1.0
